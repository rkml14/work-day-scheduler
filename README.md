# 05  Work Day Scheduler


## Description

I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of a standard business day (0am to 5pm).  The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, along with [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time.  

In order for the user to manage their time effectively, they are presented with a daily planner to create their schedule with the current date & time displayed at the top of the calendar.   Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether the time slot is in the past, present or future.   The user can enter their task into the appropriate time block and click the save button to retain their task.  When the user refreshes the page, the task is saved and persists in the planner for them.   


## Installation

Access the application via https://rkml14.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

The user chooses the time slot for a task that is to be done, and can enter in information regarding said task and click on the save button to retain it.  They have the option of hourly time slots form 9am to 5pm in which they can enter in tasks to be completed.  The save button must be clicked in order to retain the task if the browser is closed or refreshed.
